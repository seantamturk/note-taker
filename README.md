# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is an application that allows users to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and retrieves and stores note data from a JSON file.

The goal of this project is to build the back end of the application, connect it to the front end, and deploy the entire application to Heroku. By completing this challenge, I gained practical experience with key web development technologies such as Express.js, routing, and working with JSON data.

In addition to building a functional note-taking application, this project helped me develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with both front-end and back-end technologies. Completing the Note Taker challenge is an important step in my development as a web developer and prepares me for future web development challenges.
